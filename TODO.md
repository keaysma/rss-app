# TODOs
You over enter a room on a house tour or something and try to turn on the lights, but nothing happens... then you look up and see that there's just two wires coming out of the ceiling? TODO...

- [x] Allow editing of feeds
- [x] Make feed article list it's own separate and proper page so browser back/forth works
- [ ] Add setting to change open style for different feeds (open in view, on in new page)
- [ ] Mark as read, hide, keeping track of when articles were read with another table
- [ ] Add support for openrss.org as a proxy - explore if this can be done within their rules ([looks like it can](https://openrss.org/guides/using-a-self-hosted-reader-with-open-rss-feeds))
- [ ] Service worker
    - [ ] Scans while away from page
    - [ ] Leaves notifications on changes
- [ ] Light mode/Dark mode switcher
- [ ] Fix relative URLs not working (Add <base/> tag)
- [ ] See if CORS Buster-mode could be better fixed
    - Support for re-writing embedded links to go through CORS Buster?
- [ ] Look into supporting other things (what is ATOM? I literally don't know)
